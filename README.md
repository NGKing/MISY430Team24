=============

Our app name is called UDine. It is an iPhone application for University of Delaware students to track their meals, points and nutritional info during the semester. 

The several dining halls (Rodney, Russel, etc) will be listed and students can see what they are preparing for the three different meals: breakfast, lunch and dinner. Essentially, we want this to be a portal app for students to track their meal plans and help them further decide where they want to eat. 

A nutritional calculator and tracker will also be individualized to a user, as they can track the calories they are consuming throughout the day. Essentially, every food item in our database will have nutritional info paired with it.
